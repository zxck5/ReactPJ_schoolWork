                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My specific goal is actually studying hacking and security. I really felt interested about them and if I ever have 
                a chance to study them, I want to give it a try even though it is difficult .<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I studied Java and algorithms deeply, I found that I got interest in solving algorithms after all and I think good solving skills can contribute
                to have good background knowledge in forming program in particular issues. Also, when I was in highschool, I got worried because I didn't do math for 5years when I started studying algorithms.
                However, I decided to study deep in algorithms because it was exciting somehow.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in highschool, I was good at vector and functions and it is little similar with it. When I studied algorithms, it was all connected and
                I got impressed by how the formulas are formed in recurrence relation. I tried to interpret and did some 
                inductive reasoning in mathematic perspective and it was interesting.
                <br><br>
                After I graduate this course, I decided to become java developer and earn money for the further studies.
                <br><br>
                I'd like to introduce my role model who gave me passsion about challenging.</kbd></p>

                <p><kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that he was a police officer,<br> 
                    he was one of the greatest bodybuilder. He dedicated<br>
                    his life to family, police job and bodybuilding.<br>
                    Even though he ended up being retired and stay hospital<br>
                    for the rest of his life due to the accidents<br>
                    and injuries, he had no regrets about bodybuilding</kbd>

                        I believe that he brought out a great impact on people who are<br>
                        struggling to work, study, and etc. He certainly proved that with<br>
                        a lot of effort on something can make great improvement.
